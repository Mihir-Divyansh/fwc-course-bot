# This file imports all addons to be loaded by the bot

# Why not just add the functionality to bot?
# because the addon code might get depreciated in the future
# if it is loaded as addon, it can be easily removed without worrying about how the 
# rest of the code behaves.

import addons.hello_world as hello_world
